# Janitor

**Lightweight discord.js bot**
>this bot was first made in 2017 
>> at this time i was currently in my second year of highschool <br>

I used this a first-step into learning the node.js libary and most importantly JavaScript<br>
This broadened my skills in javascript and now can write commands fluently without issue
